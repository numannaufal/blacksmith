# blacksmith

Jakarta, 23 July 2022: 2AM. Blood heavily flow in my brain.
Possible limited ideas generated. Execution can't
be postponed. Hand full of mud.

I don't know why I've just realized, the versioning system can
be a perfect place to organize knowledge, at least my knowledge.
Many things that I learned since child, many of them evaporated.
The best learning / education that I experienced so far is when
it is applicable. I assume the unapplicable was the exploration step,
or not just yet to be applied.

This blacksmith comes up to mind with it will give you the ability to reach
your goal more effective and efficient. You spike the nail with hammer, cut
down the tree with axe, water plants with watery can, catch the fish with
fishing rod, and so on. The tool itself is created. You create the tool with
knowledge. With organized knowledge, I hope we can create many tools that
we could to reach the goal.

I think we shouldn't limit the scope of just software. Yes the versioning
itself is software, but let's creativity flow beyond. With combination of
many knowledge, who knows something great will happen. Good luck!
